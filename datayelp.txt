Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table =10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table =10000
v. elite_years table =10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table =10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000

#Code: 
SELECT COUNT(*) as total
FROM business

2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 17671
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 6493
viii. Tip = 10000
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.


3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:no

	select id

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours? (YES)


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews? (YES)
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
Based on the results, we can see that there seems to be a correlation between the location of the business and their rating. The business that are probably located in the same neighbor have close rating. Also they have similar working hours. Moreover, the business that have longer working hours usually have higher rating. 


SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT b.id, b.stars,b.review_count, b.city, b.is_open, c.category,c.business_id, h.hours, h.business_id
FROM business b
INNER JOIN category c ON b.id = c.business_id
INNER JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id
GROUP BY b.stars

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:hours of opening, categories 
         
         
ii. Difference 2: business which is closed have less stars and less reviews
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT b.id, b.stars,b.review_count, b.city, b.is_open, c.category,c.business_id, h.hours, h.business_id
FROM business b
INNER JOIN category c ON b.id = c.business_id
INNER JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id
GROUP BY b.is_open


3. 	For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you
	want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.
	
	Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment 
	analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, 
	predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a 
	user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel 
	free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide
	answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
	i. 	Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
	
	Finding correlation between the likes with the given rates and using ?like? in the reviews. 
	ii.	Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
			
I need two sources of data (tables). First, I join these two tables based on users and business. Then I sort them based on rating to see if there is a correlation between the number of stars and likes. 
The reason I chose this analysis and thus, the data sets is that psychologists have shown that how people think about something can completely change even after a few minutes and they think that how people think just after occurrence of an event is a better representative for the quality of that event compared to what they say after thinking about it. Because tip table is related to the occurrence of the event (shopping) and they write a review after hours or even days, comparing these two tables can help us to explore the validity what psychologists claim. As the result shows there is a slight correlation between the number of likes and stars, but this correlation is not strong. So what psychologists claim seems to be fairly valid.  
		
	iii.	Output of your finished dataset:
	
+-------+-------+
| stars | likes |

|     3 |     2 |
|     5 |     2 |
